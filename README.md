#Overall
Colloidal systems (hereinafter referred to as "colloidal" only) is a form of mixture (dispersion system) of two or more substances that are homogeneous but has a dispersed particle size is quite large (1-100 nm), and thus subject to the Tyndall effect. Means homogeneous dispersed particles are not affected by gravity or other forces imposed on him; thus no precipitation occurs, for example. Homogeneous properties are shared by the solution, but not owned by the usual mixture (suspension).

Colloidal easily found everywhere: milk, gelatin, ink, shampoo, and the clouds are examples of colloids that can be found everyday. The cytoplasm of the cells is also a colloidal system. Colloidal chemistry to be studied separately because of its importance in the chemical industry.
